# Note Taker

## Description

This project modifies starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.


## User Story

I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```


## Features:


- Landing page with a link to a notes page
- A page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
- A new note is entered with both a title and the note’s text
- Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page, and the new note entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
- When the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column
- When the user clicks on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, the user is presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
